Hello! This repository is for storing my solutions to LeetCode problems. I created it because I love SQL and want to document my daily journey with it 😸. 

Beside that, I also want to write a something everyday pure without AI (like chatgpt), in the hope so that I can refresh my mind and keep my creative thinking alive 🦋🍓.

Each problem has its own folder, which contains:

Every problem has 1 folder that each contains:
1. question.txt: the problem/question that must be solved
2. solve.sql: the solution that I made
3. explanation.md: how's my thought process, why did I come up with that solution and how that solution works.
4. other files if necessary

Thank you for reading this <3
