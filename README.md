Hello! This repository is for storing my solutions to leetcode problems. I created it because I want to document my daily journey with it 😸. 

Beside that, I also want to write a something everyday pure without AI (like chatgpt), in the hope so that I can refresh my mind and keep my creative thinking alive 🦋🍓.

Each problem has its own folder, which contains:
1. question.txt: the problem/question that must be solved
2. solve.md: the solution that I made and how's my thought process, why did I come up with that solution and how that solution works.
3. other files if necessary

Thank you for reading this <3
