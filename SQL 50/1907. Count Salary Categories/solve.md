EXPLANATION:
<br>
As simple as create CTE for every salary category, with counting how many accounts that are in a category, and then union it all. However, I found that my approach is not very effective. I read a solution from another submission that uses a CASE statement. This approach eliminates the needs to create 3 CTEs (which is much more optimal since it avoids scanning the table three times).
